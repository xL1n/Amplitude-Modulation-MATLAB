# Amplitude_modulation_MATLAB
This is a amplitude modulation code i write in Year 2 of my BEng EEE study 

The "BER_function" is MATLAB function which calculate the BER for random number of N bits signal, the code include the process of modulating the binary signal onto COS carrier wave and transmit through AWGN channel, then demodulate, and pass through LP filter to remove the extra frequency components caused by demodulation process, finally convert the filtered signal back to binary signal and compare with input signal in order to find the error hence BER
